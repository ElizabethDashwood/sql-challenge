## Module 9 EmployeeSQL Challenge

### Description: 
This is the Module 9 EmployeeSQL using pg4Admin in PostgreSQL 16 on Windows

### Getting started: 
This challenge has 1 project called: EmployeeSQL using 6 starter code csv files called:
  departments.csv
  dept_emp.csv
  dept_manager.csv
  employees.csv
  salaries.csv
  titles.csv  

### Installations required: 
This project required the installation of PostgreSQL 16 with pg4Admin on Windows

### Executing Challenge 9 Requirements:
For the Data Modelling exercise, the Quick DataBase Diagrams application (Reference: https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/RNoZZZ) was used to contruct the Entitle Relationship Diagram and associated schema.  
See the files named **QuickDBD-EmployeeSQL ERD Challenge 9** and **QuickDBD-EmployeeSQL Field List - Challenge 9** for the results of this exercise

For the Data Engineering exercise, Postgres 16 pg4admin was used to create the tables, and load the data to each table from the 6 starter code csv files mentioned above.  These starter files are located in the EmployeeSQL folder in this repository.
See the file named **Data Engineering - creating tables and loading data from CSV files.sql** for the results of this exercise

For the Data Analysis exercise, Postgres 16 pg4admin was used to create the queries that provide the data result for the 8 task questions. 
See the file named **Data Analysis queries for EmployeeSQL.sql** for the queries resulting from this exercise
NOTE:  To test and validate the results of these queries, I did also create views and do many counts of rows within results.  These views and queries for counts are not required to be submitted, so have not been included in this repository.
I have included a screenprint of the first few rows of the resulting data from each query, as confirmation of the output result for each tasks.  See file names **EmployeeSQL query results**
